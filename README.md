# activity-log-cleaner
Google Chrome extension that removes posts and comments from facebook.

## This is extension is made for personal usage and is a WORK IN PROGRESS!
Already removed everything from my personal facebook activity log using this extension.
It is not ment to be userfriendly at this time, rather a personal example of how to create a simple chrome extension.

** NOTE TO SELF: The activity log has a lot of bugs when trying to remove content **
